<h1>Grasshopper OrigamiSIM </h1>

<p> <strong>Grasshopper OrigamiSIM</strong> is a single algorithm aimed at simulating the <strong>folding</strong> and <strong>unfolding</strong> of Origami <strong>Crease Patterns (CP)</strong>.
CPs are drawn in <strong>Rhino</strong> as curves and then imported into <strong>Grasshopper</strong>.</p>

The main contributor to this tool is <strong>Riccardo Foschi</strong>, who began this research as a personal project in 2017 during his PhD. Several other researchers have contributed to its development—directly or indirectly—within the context of the <a href="https://structuralorigami.com/">Structural Origami Gatherings</a>. 
  
</p> Special thanks to Rupert Maleczek, whose precious advice helped resolve several issues, gave ideas for new features, and actively contributed to improving many aspects of the algorithm. And many thanks to Duks Koschitz, who contributed to beta-testing also with the help of his students at the d.r.a. Lab at Pratt, Brooklyn, NY.
